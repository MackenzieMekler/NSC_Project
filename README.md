# analysis.R script
When doing data analysis in ImageJ, we made a different measurements .csv file for every single image that was analyzed. Some lines go across different passage dates and there are about 3-4 images taken and analyzed at each different passage date for each line so this script aims to take all of the information obtained and put it into one place to be analyzed and graphed automatically rather than by opening every .csv file. By doing this we will be able to quickly access updated information and easily add new lines to analysis just by changing a few lines of code. 
## Expected filetree for script
In order to work without adjustments, this is the file structure that the project expects and requires.
